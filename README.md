# Intersection Area Calculator

# ðŸ“Œ What it does

This project calculates the overlapping area between two 2D shapes (like rectangles and parallelograms) using C++.

# ðŸŽ¯ Why it was made

I made this project to learn how to design and structure software. I'm practicing how to plan code before writing it, find mistakes in my thinking, and improve step by step.
There is no OOP used  â€” this is on purpose, to start learning from simple, procedural code and move to more complex designs later.
